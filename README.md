# Uiza

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/uiza`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "uiza"
```

And then execute:

```ruby
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```ruby
$ gem install uiza
```

### Requirements

* Ruby 2.0+.

## Usage

The library needs to be configured with your account's `workspace_api_domain` and `authorization` (API key).
See details [here](https://docs.uiza.io/#authentication).
Set `Uiza.workspace_api_domain` and `Uiza.authorization` with your values:

## Ruby
```ruby
require "uiza"
Uiza.workspace_api_domain = "your-workspace-api-domain.uiza.co"
Uiza.authorization = "your-authorization"
```

## ROR
Create file `your-app/config/initializers/uiza.rb`
```ruby
Uiza.workspace_api_domain = ENV["WORKSPACE_API_DOMAIN"]
Uiza.authorization = ENV["AUTHORIZATION"]
```

## Entity
These below APIs used to take action with your media files (we called Entity)
See details [here](https://docs.uiza.io/#video).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
